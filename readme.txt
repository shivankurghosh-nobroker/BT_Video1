NoBroker Balance Transfer Video Presentation
This project presents an interactive promotional video showcasing NoBroker's Balance Transfer service'. It features:
1. A slide-based video player displaying scripted messages related to home loan balance transfer.
2. Custom-styled slides with brand colors, typography, and logo display.
3. Background music playing in a seamless loop throughout the presentation.
4. User controls including play, pause, stop, rewind (previous slide), and forward (next slide) buttons.
5. A progress bar and slide indicators for navigation and progress tracking.
6. A call-to-action button that directly initiates a phone call to the NoBroker contact number.
The video player automatically advances through slides but allows full manual control for the user. It is tailored for a smooth, professional marketing experience across devices.
